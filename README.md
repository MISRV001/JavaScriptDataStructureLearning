2. **Work with variables and data in JavaScript.**
   - Use attributes and methods to communicate with users, including the type attribute.
   - Define variables, data types and scope.
   - List keywords and reserved words.
   - Store user input in variables and evaluate for appropriate responses using the console and built-in methods such as alert() and prompt().
   - Distinguish between concatenation and addition.
   - Use Apply operators, including string concatenation ( += ), strict comparison ( === , !==), mathematical precedence and bitwise operators.
   - Demonstrate how to use expressions.
   - Implement simple event handlers, including keyboard, mouse and mobile (gestures or touch) events.
3. **Use JavaScript functions, methods, and events.**
   - Define and use methods as functions.
   - Demonstrate the use of various types of functions and function elements including prototype functions, anonymous functions, closure functions, arguments and the use of return values.
   - Distinguish between global and local variables. 
   - Use the conditional operator.
   - Identify user events and event handlers.
   - Demonstrate the use of function specific methods including calling, binding and applying.
   - Use built-in functions and cast variables.

## **Part 2: Intermediate JavaScript Programming Techniques**

1. **Debug and troubleshoot JavaScript code.**
   - Demonstrate common steps for debugging JavaScript code, including reviewing code and testing code in different browsers and various devices.
   - Demonstrate how to use various native and supplemental debugging tools, including enabling/disabling display.
2. **Use JavaScript statements to control program flow.**
   - Use the if... statement.
   - Use the while... statement.
   - Use the do...while statement.
   - Use the for... statement.
   - Use the forEach statement.
   - Use the break and continue statements.
   - Use the switch... statement.
3. **Use the JavaScript Document Object Model (DOM).**
   - Use JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM).
   - Use the window object of the DOM.
   - Manipulate properties and methods of the document object within the DOM.
   - Use the image object of the DOM, including image rollover creation.
   - Use the history object of the DOM.
   - Evaluate and change URL information with the location object of the DOM.
   -  Use the navigator object of the DOM.
   - Describe virtual DOM.
4. **Use JavaScript language objects and create expressions.**
   - Use the String object to test user input.
   - Evaluate strings, including use of the length property, and use of the indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), substring() and charAt() methods.
   - Implement basic regular expressions and the RegExp object.
   - Use the Array object to create more efficient code.
   - Use the map() method.
   - Apply the Date and Math objects.
5. **Create and use custom JavaScript objects.**
   - Create a custom JavaScript object.
   - Define properties and methods of custom objects.
   - Create new object instances.
   - Create client-side arrays using custom objects.
   - Create functions and methods for manipulating client-side arrays.
   - Use the prototype property, concept of classes, constructors, iterators and generators.

## **Part 3: Applied JavaScript**

1. **Modify HTML with JavaScript.**
   - Identify steps and methods for changing HTML "on the fly," including the getElementById, getElementsByName, getElementsByTagName and getElementsByClassName methods of the DOM.
   - Modify attributes in HTML using DOM elements.
   - Modify form object values.
2. **Use JavaScript to develop interactive forms.**
   - Identify and use form controls, including HTML5 form elements.
   - Define the form object.
   - Refer to form objects, including input, text, textarea, radio, checkbox, select, button, password, hidden, file and submit.
   - Use form objects, including radio, select, button, text, input, textarea, checkbox, password, hidden, file and submit. 
   - Conduct form validation.
   - Identify common form security issues.
3. **Address JavaScript security issues involving browsers and cookies.**
   - Distinguish between the browser and the operating system in relation to the elements responsible for security.
   - Discuss browser security issues relevant to JavaScript, including script blocking, frame-toframe URL changing, and document.write behavior differences among browsers.
   - Define signed scripts.
   - Perform client-side browser detection and determine browser compatibility.
   - Identify common issues and procedures for creating secure JavaScript code.
   - Define cross-site scripting and the associated security risks.
   - Define the functions and common uses of cookies.
   - Manipulate cookies effectively, including testing for presence of cookies, clearing cookies, enabling/disabling cookies in the browser, and deleting cookies from your hard drive.
   - Discuss ethics in collecting, storing, using and protecting user data.

## **Part 4: JavaScript Technology Extensions**
